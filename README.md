# Rebounce-Game-Development
This rebound game is solely built with Vanilla JavaScript. User is able to choose the difficulty levels which are categorised into Easy, Medium and Difficult. Users may also turn on the sound effects for a more pleasant user experience. The speed of the ball increases when it collides with the edge of the paddle to increase the difficulty.
